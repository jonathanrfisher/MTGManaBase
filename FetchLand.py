# Fetchlands allow you to pay 1 life and fetch one of two
# different basic land types.

# For the purpose of testing for standard, we will consider
# only the friendly aligned fetch lands.

# Similar to the battle lands, friendly fetch lands can
# have the following combinations and can fetch the
# corresponding basic land types:
# 1. UW (Island, Plains)
# 2. UB (Island, Swamp)
# 3. GW (Forest, Plains)
# 4. GR (Forest, Mountain)
# 5. RB (Mountain, Swamp)
